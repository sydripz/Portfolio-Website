              </h1>
                  <p> I am a Web and UX Designer with a passion for building and
                      refining interfaces, processes and experiences. I thrive in
                      a feedback driven environment while being self directed and
                      goal oriented.

              <p> Olive is a socially based workout creation and sharing
              platform. Olive creates a space for users to publish their own
            workouts while engaging with their friends workouts through saving,
            sharing and commenting on the content. </p>

            <h4>Reasearch</h4>
                <p>
                  Before beginning my design work, I knew that clarification of
                  the health and fitness industry market as well as user reserarch
                  was foundational to creating a valuable product.
                </P>
                <p>
                  I found that most fitness apps were tied to a certain influencer
                  or company, but there were few in the marketplace that prioritized
                  the ability for users to create and elevate their workout content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some fitness apps like Strava allow users to create and guide the
                  content of the app... but a gym specific, user populated app seems
                  to have been missed within the marketplace. Instead, gym-goers
                  have to navigate between multiple platforms like Instagram, TikTok,
                  and YouTube to find and compile workouts.

              <source srcset="img/profiledesktop.jpg" media="(max-width:1200px)">

            </picture>
            <div>
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p>
                  Olive is a workout app specific to the gym & weighlifting, and
                  the user personas created after analyzing the research refelct
                  the diversity within this environment. I created three user personas
                  to represent the fitness influencer with years of experience,
                  the gym newbie, and the typical gym-bro type.
                </P>
                <p>
                  User flows were vital to helping shape the flows of key features
                  within the app. The creation of user journeys worked in tandem
                  to help identify how to create the most intuitive and fluid
                  journey for a user to take to accomplish a goal.
