          <p> I was brought on as a web designer to help ClubCorp transition
            200+ club websites over to a new CMS platform. The goal of this
            project was to modernize the look of the websites while conveying
            the storytelling aspects specific to each individual club.  </p>

            <h4>Understanding & Optimizing the capabilities of the new CMS system</h4>
            <p>
              The first challenge that I faced was learning the different capabilities
              specific to the new CMS system. In order to build both functional & aesthetic websites,
               I focused on understanding how different elements correlated with one another.
               This included understanding copy constraints, image functionality within
               elements, color scheme & branding across elements and team member/
               golf course details content specific pages.
            </P>
            <p>
              The CMS learning phase of this project involved much trial & error,
              comprehensive note taking, and many wireframes that would lead to the
              ability to output 1-1.5 websites a day after learning the ins & outs of the system.
            </p>

            <h4>Wireframes, Page Structure & Content</h4>
            <p>
              A key process in my web design role was creating wireframes
              specific to each website that capitalized on the visual &
              functional capabilities present within the new software.
              From the onset of the project, configuring the elements within
              the new website to best display copy, imagery and flow was highly
              important.
            </P>
            <p>
              While many websites were centered within the Golf & Country club
              market, each had different page structure, copy and storytelling needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I personally communicated with each country, city and stadium club
              as well as different departments within the ClubCorp organization
              to obtain all information & materials to construct a unique and
              meaningful website. This included gathering videos specific to
              different clubs, copy that highlighted their individual assets,
              and reorganizing the page structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many clubs had a large subpage structure which was difficult to
              navigate. The subpages contained valuable information, but the
               individual pages lacked flow and rich content. In order to remedy
               this, I would combine subpages in order to increase the quality
                of the UX experience. Many subpages would have their content
                integrated into the main page, while some clubs were better
                served with combining and redefining subpages.
            </p>

            <h4>Prioritizing project management to launch websites</h4>
            <p>
              An integral part of successfully launching 200+ websites was honing
               in on my project management skills. After presenting the new
               website to the team members of each corresponding club, I would
               set a concise schedule of when preliminary/finals edits, image
               updates, and copy updates needed to be received in order for me
               to implement the changes to the website pre-launch.
            </P>
            <p>
              Explaining website functionality, software constraints, and
              new features quickly became one of the most exciting parts of my
              job. The ability to educate and align all team members on the
              transition of the website, and the vision for improved storytelling
              and user experience helped keep each website on track with its
              launch date. Explaining the how, the why, and the vision created
              a team that was on the same page despite being in different time
              zones, states and schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the course of the website redesign project I was in
              active communication with over 200 team members across the country
              in order to successfully present, edit and launch around 50 websites
               out of the 200 team total.

            <h4>Website Iteration post launch</h4>
            <p>
              With four distinct website launch phases, I was responsible for
              communicating with clubs to ensure that their new website was
              fine tuned for members & prospect experience. This included
               manually checking all links to ensure correct redirects &
               functionality as well as updating any edits clubs requested
               post launch.
            </P>
            <p>
              Throughout my time as a Web Designer, I would wireframe and
              create new websites while fielding requests from clubs whose
              websites were live in order to fine tune details and/or add new
              content. This iteration outlook ensured the most optimized user
              experience and client satisfaction.

          Throughout my time as a Web Designer at ClubCorp, I learned invaluable
          skills in design, project management and optimizing user experience.
          I remember logging on to our new CMS system for the first time and
          just hoping I wouldn’t mess anything up too tremendously… 8 months
          later and creating websites felt like smooth sailing (most of the
          time). Thanks to my team for all the support & open lines of
          communication. This project will always have a special place in
          my heart!
